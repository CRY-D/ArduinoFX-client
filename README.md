and here for description of installation of embedded server:

The JavaFX application connects to a server (See https://github.com/jperedadnr/ArduinoFX-server) to grab via RESTful
web services the values of the measures stored in an embedded database.

Main tasks are:

    -Connect to the server to get last measures and show them in a LED Matrix Panel control.
    -Connect to the server to get a list of measures between two dates, showing them in a chart. 
    -Show the status of the connection anytime.

Custom controls from http://jfxtras.org are used.

Comments are really welcome.
